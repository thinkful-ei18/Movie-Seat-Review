Product Reviewer App:
Backend 	- MongoDB database hosted by MLAB.
	  	- Node Express for endpoint and routes.
		- Passport and Google Auth (Not working completely yet)

Frontend	-React and Redux client side

Deployment	-Heroku

The App allows users to review products and see other product reviews submitted to the site. The eventual goal is to get user to review products and also edit their reviews over time. The goal database will contain a collection of products and within those documents a collection of reviews. At the moment its simply a collection of reviews. Future implementation will work with an API. Have a social network of sorts where people can see each others reviews for a certain product. A filter or search feature is also necessary.
